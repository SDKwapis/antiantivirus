# Description
Your computer may have been infected by a 'virus'! This is a JS function that finds the 'viruses' in files and removes them.

# Installation
CD into the project. Run 'node script.js'. Watch the virus files magically disappear!

# Usage
Run the function and be amazed by my wizardry.

# Contributing
This was a challenge from the Sloth Bytes newsletter. So thanks for putting that out there, Mr. Sloth.
